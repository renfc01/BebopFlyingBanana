## Synopsis

NUS Orbital 2015 Project

This application aims to add face detection features for the Parrot Bebop quadcopter and issue movement commands in order to facilitate the taking of a group photo. The target is autonomous control with manual controls as fallback. 

The drone will be controlled via an Android app, which will receive and process the live H.264 video feed and control the drone, either autonomously or manually. Image processing is done using OpenCV.

Created using Java, incorporating ARDroneSDK3 and OpenCV 3.0 libraries in a Linux environment.
